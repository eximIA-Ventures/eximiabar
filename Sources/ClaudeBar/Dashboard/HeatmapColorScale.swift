/// Non-linear colour scale for the activity heatmap (EXB-4.1).

/// The EXB-3.7 baseline fed a **linear** `0 … max` domain to Swift Charts'
/// `chartForegroundStyleScale`. Claude usage is exponentially distributed — one or two peak hours
/// dwarf everything else — so the linear ramp pushed the vast majority of non-zero cells into the
/// bottom sliver of opacity, rendering them effectively invisible against the dark card. With real
/// data (peak 480.5M, median 62.3M) the median cell mapped to ~13% opacity; the smallest non-zero
/// cell to <1%.
///
/// This type replaces that with a **logarithmic** transform (`log1p`, so `log(0)` never occurs) and a
/// hard `0.08` floor for any non-zero cell, guaranteeing every hour with activity is distinguishable
/// from both the dark background and the neutral "zero" cells. Under log1p the same real data lifts
/// the median to ~90% and the smallest cell to ~71% — every busy hour reads clearly.
///
/// Pure, stateless `static` functions: no I/O, no `DateFormatter`/`NumberFormatter`, no allocation
/// beyond the returned `Color`. Safe to call from any thread and from inside a chart `body`
/// (anti-freeze invariant — EPIC-EXB transversal rule).
